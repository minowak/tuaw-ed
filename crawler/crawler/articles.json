This generally isn't the case with hardware \u2013 no, the iPhone 6 doesn't really bend, unless you apply a lot of pressure to it \u2013 but rather with software. Bugs abound; shoddy releases are followed by broken updates. Echoing this sentiment, Russell Ivanovic wrote the following earlier this month: wrote the following Tim Cook keeps telling us that 'Only Apple' could do the amazing things it does. I just wish that Apple would slow down their breakneck pace and spend the time required to build stable software that their hardware so desperately needs. The yearly release cycles of OS X, iOS, iPhone & iPad are resulting in too many things seeing the light of day that aren't finished yet. Perhaps the world wouldn't let them, perhaps the expectations are now too high, but I'd kill for Snow iOS 8 and Snow Yosemite next year. I'm fairly confident I'm not alone in that feeling.

The Spinn Case (US$59) is the latest in an all-leather sleeve for Apple's larger smartphones, but with a literal twist. Waterfield Designs Spinn Case Design Design If you like all-natural materials, you'll love the Spinn Case. It's made of full grain leather, stitched ruggedly around the perimeter, with a flap that goes over the top of the phone that's secured by a \"pin and slit\" closure. The bottom is left wide open, perfect for attaching your earpods or charging your phone. The Spinn feature is the big deal here: it's a patent-pending spool made of the same leather that you simply wrap your earpods around. Spinn's great for making sure that your cables don't get tangled up while you're not wearing them - much better than just stuffing them into a pocket!   Waterfield Designs also offers this case with a belt clip ($10 extra) and you can get it for either naked iPhone 6/6 Plus models (no case) or those with a thin case installed. The leather comes in three finishes: Black, Grizzly, and Chocolate. Functionality Functionality Hey. It's a sleeve. Your phone goes into it, the top flap flops over the top and can be closed with that handy little closure, and the rest is history. If you drop your iPhone, it will probably survive, although this isn't one of those three-layer TPU/PTE/Silicone mashups. In our plastic, glass and aluminum world, I really appreciate the natural look and feel of something like the Spinn Case. It's going to wear with age and look even better after a few years.   Conclusion Conclusion About my only complaint about the rugged Spinn Case is the price, which seems to be somewhat higher than I'd expect for a few pieces of leather sewn together. If you're in the market for a protective sleeve for an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, perhaps with a belt clip and definitely with an innovative way to keep your earbuds from tangling, this is a solid bet.

For one thing, there was always the speakers, which seemed to be an added afterthought and never provided decent stereo sound. Sengled's new Pulse Dimmable LED lights with wireless speakers (US$179 for a pair) are the first to provide a master/satellite setup that ensures true stereo sound in a bright and energy-efficient light fixture.    Sengled's new Pulse Dimmable LED lights with wireless speakers  Specifications US Version: works in any standard E26 socket Power Consumption: 15W typical, 30W peak Dimensions: 5.46\" height x 3.86\" diameter Weight: 14.82 ounces Audio System Power: 13 watts, with 1.75\" full-range high-fidelity speaker, 100 Hz - 20 kHz frequency response Bluetooth Standard: v2.1 + EDR, with A2DP, AVRCP, SPP profiles Design Design  Where some of the early LED light/speaker combos had laughably bad designs, Sengled obviously put some thought into the design of the Pulse. The lights have a tympani-like shape, with a gentle flare and scalloping that's reminiscent of a tulip. There are two exterior finishes, pewter and candy apple red.     Being almost 4 inches in diameter, you'll need to put some thought into what fixtures you put the lights into. Sengled's website shows the lights going into a recessed ceiling fixture, which would be perfect for this design.  The lights are set up as a master device and a satellite device that can placed up to 100 feet apart (line of sight). Your iPhone or iPad, running the Pulse by Sengled app (free), can stream just about any music source directly to the master device. It then beams the stereo channel to the satellites (you will eventually be able to have up to eight speaker bulbs) over a 5 GHz wireless network. Pulse by Sengled  Functionality Functionality  Installation of the Pulse lights is as simple as screwing a light bulb into a socket. Once the light is installed and power turned on, you fire up the app, which displays a welcome page while searching for the master light. Once connected, the app displays a control screen with two tabs -- \"Lights\" and \"Sound\".    Each tab has a \"dial\" that you can swipe in a circle to control the intensity of the light or the volume of sound. It's a very intuitive UI, much easier to understand than some of the bizarre apps I've seen with other light/speaker combos.  The app also includes an \"equalizer\", which is actually just 7 sound effect settings: normal, pop, jazz, classical, rock, vocal and movie. The sound from the speakers, as you'd expect, is quite a bit better than what I've heard from other light/speaker combos on the market. While it can't compete with dedicated wireless speaker systems, the sound from the JBL speakers is fairly impressive.  Conclusion Conclusion  Pulse by Sengled is a well-designed light/speaker combo that addresses the poor audio quality associated with many similar products. The price is reasonable compared to other less-capable speaker lights, and the design is attractive and functional. Coupled with an easy-to-use iOS app, Pulse is definitely worth considering if you're in the market for this type of combination Bluetooth accessory.

{"author": "Steven Sande", "url": "http://www.tuaw.com/2014/10/14/alpine-headphones-tout-immersive-experience-level-play-iphone/", "timestamp": "Oct 14th 2014 at 5:00PM", "authorTwitter": "http://twitter.com/stevensande", "comments": [], "content": "Alpine has long been one of the big names associated with car audio systems, but the company has never really made a splash with connected personal audio until today. The company just launched Alpine Headphones that are available in Apple Stores around the world for a suggested retail price of US$299. So how did Alpine do with its first consumer headphone product? Read on for our review.    Alpine Alpine Headphones Specifications Specifications Weight: 12.6 ounces (357 grams) Impedence: 30 \u00b1 20% Ohms at 1kHz Frequency response: 15Hz - 24,000Hz Sound pressure level: 107dB \u00b1 3dB at 1kHz max Total harmonic distortion: \\<0.1% at 1mW/1kHz Colors: Apollo White, Onyx Black Includes: USB to micro-USB charging cable, iPhone audio cable with microphone, carry bag Design Design The Alpine Headphones are stunning. The white pair reviewed by TUAW has a very futuristic design, with a matte plastic band cushioned on the inside with a black matte foam. The earcups are diamond-shaped, with controls on the bottom of the left cup. Those controls are quite simple - there's just a power button. All the rest of the adjustments are made through the companion Level Play app (free). Level Play app   Alpine Headphones and Level Play app Alpine Headphones and Level Play app Alpine Headphones and Level Play app                  The app scans your music library, creating an \"intensity based\" playlist. What does that mean? The app looks at the beats per minute and sound wave frequency of each tune, then organizes the music library into one of three categories. Want a high-energy music experience? You swipe your finger up to the \"orange\" level. Looking to calm down and relax? Swipe your finger down to the \"blue\" level. It's a unique way at organizing music, that's for sure. I was a bit confused about the inclusion of a braided audio cable with the Alpine Headphones as I thought they were Bluetooth. You'll see my confusion when you look at the promo video below, where everybody is dancing around with the headphones on - without a cable in sight.   It turns out the Alpine Headphones are actually somewhat of a hybrid. The actual audio information goes through the cable from your iPhone to the headphones, but the custom settings you make in the app are transmitted to the headphones through Bluetooth LE. No misleading advertising here... Functionality Functionality   While the Level Play app provides a way to tweak your music library so that it sounds great, you're out of luck if you listen to other music sources. Sure, you can use the Alpine Headphones to listen to Spotify, iTunes Radio, or whatever else you like for streaming music, but you won't be able to adjust the equalization to your tastes as the music doesn't go through the Level Play app. Conclusion Conclusion If you're listening to your own music library on an iPhone, then you may want to consider the Alpine Headphones simply for the modern design as well as for the Level Play app and its ability to let you have a modicum of control over five separate frequency ranges. For those who either need a pair of headphones that can be useful with a number of devices, or who listen to streaming video, I'm not sure I can recommend these headphones. For $50 more, you could pick up a pair of top-rated Blue Microphones Mo-Fi amped headphones that sound great regardless of what device you're connected to or what music source you're using.

{"author": "Steven Sande", "url": "http://www.tuaw.com/2014/10/14/avid-watch-sports-smartwatch-launches-on-kickstarter-a-first-lo/", "timestamp": "Oct 14th 2014 at 6:00PM", "authorTwitter": "http://twitter.com/stevensande", "comments": [], "content": "Fitness wearables are the hot thing now, with a surprising number of new entrants rushing into the world where only Fitbit used to tread. Today, Vancouver-based AvidSport launched a Kickstarter campaign to get a new sports smartwatch called Avid Watch into production and in stores by April of 2015.   AvidSport Avid Watch What's different about Avid Watch? A lot of things. Sure, the watch itself has connectivity to your iPhone and there's an app for tracking your activity and changing settings -- many sports smartwatches have that capability. But the Avid Watch has built-in functions not only for running and walking, but cycling and golf as well. To enable tracking of your rides, runs, or golf rounds, Avid Watch comes with a separate wrist-borne device -- Avid Track -- so that you don't need to have your iPhone with you for GPS capabilities. With that short explanation out of the way, let's talk a bit about the pre-production device that I was able to test recently. Design Design The Avid Watch follows the tried and true design meme that seems to follow most smartwatches: it's a boxy little device, equipped out of the box with a flexible hypoallergenic silicone band. The band is about an inch wide and very comfortable on extended wear, and if you wish to, you can replace it with any other band you desire. The case of the watch is made of anodized aluminum, and there's a very useful display for telling you everything you'll need to know. That case is 1.48 inches wide at its widest point, and 1.67 inches high. It's about .48 inches thick.   There are four buttons on the device - one on the top left side, three others spaced equally on the right side. While the left button is used to power the watch on and off, the buttons on the right are used to navigate the user interface. This makes it much easier to move through the various screens -- that was one of the major problems I had with Wellograph. Wellograph Like Wellograph, the Avid Watch uses a monochrome display with a backlight that can be turned on with a push of the power button. The display is 1.26 inches diagonal, with 144 x 168 pixels resolution. The Avid Watch has a number of watch displays that you can choose from, and the watch is automatically set to your local time upon syncing it to your iPhone for the first time. The device also displays local weather by showing an icon (sun, cloud, etc...) and the temperature. I found the Avid Watch display to be much more readable under a variety of lighting conditions than the Wellograph.   Avid Watch, Avid Track and RW700 app Avid Watch, Avid Track and RW700 app Avid Watch, Avid Track and RW700 app                  Unlike the Avid Watch, the Avid Track has no display and features a bright silicone band (yellow on my test device) and case with a black top. There's one button on the device that's used to pair it with your iPhone or Avid Watch, and an LED to indicate status (red for charging, blue for on/pairing). Both devices come with magnetic charging cables; the one for the watch is more like a dock, while the other simply latches to the back of the Avid Track. Let it be known that I am not a fan of magnetic charging cables ever since I had one latch onto another plugged-in USB cable, short out, and melt the cable... Let's hear it for inductive chargers! I am not a fan of magnetic charging cables The battery is designed to last up to 41 days between charges if you're just using the Avid Watch as a timepiece. Use Bluetooth, and the battery life goes down to 4 days. In GPS mode (which I don't understand as the Watch doesn't have built-in GPS but uses Bluetooth to communicate with the iPhone or Avid Track), you'll get about 14 hours of life. Function Function Due to the short amount of time I had to test the device prior to writing this review, I can't say that I was able to give it the full workout. However, I was able to test its functionality as a step tracker and smartwatch, and even try the Avid Watch / Avid Track combo. I tested a pre-production unit, and on occasion it acted like one. For example, when I first tried to get the Avid Watch and Avid Track to pair via Bluetooth, they wouldn't connect. Other times, they synced almost immediately. My guess is that the first sync attempts were occurring inside my office where the GPS signal was nonexistent, and that was keeping things from working properly. As a smartwatch, the Avid Watch works as a wrist-mounted display to provide notifications. You'll see who calls are coming from, notifications of new mail or text messages, what's happening on your favorite social networks, reminders, and what's coming up on your calendar. One thing I could not figure out how to do is call up a history of the notifications for review. You can also do some rather fun things with the watch, like control music on your iPhone or use it as a remote shutter release for the camera on your phone. There's even a way to get your iPhone to buzz or chime if you've misplaced it, simply by pressing a button on the watch. With the accompanying RW700 app (free) on your iPhone, you're able to get a view of all of the workouts you've gone through, change settings, and send your tracked items to the Avidsport cloud. RW700 app I was particularly fascinated with the golf function. According to the Avid Sports team, the watch comes with about 3,000 golf course layouts pre-loaded. For a specific hole, the Avid Watch calculates distance to the front, center and back of the green -- no more guessing. You can also use the device as an electronic scorecard by capturing stokes and penalties, then push the information to the RW700 app and on to the Avid Sport dashboard for further analysis. Upon linking the Avid Watch and Avid Track, then giving the devices a minute to think, I was greeted with a very accurate and complete list of local golf courses. Had I been on one of the courses -- and on the first hole -- I would have seen the distances to the green as well. What's the watch missing? As far as I can tell, there's no way for it to sense and track your heart rate (you can link a Bluetooth heart rate monitor to it, but that's yet another device). Although it can act as a notification device for a number of apps, it doesn't seem to have a developer API so that third-party developers can add new notifications -- perhaps that's done by the AvidSport team. There's also no sleep tracking capability, something that is popular with those who track their health religiously. To be honest, I'm confused about the entire idea of having a second \"watch\" (the Avid Track) for the GPS function. That idea is based on runners, cyclists, and golfers not wanting to carry their smartphones with them, yet this is something that most fitness fanatics have no problems doing since they want to listen to music or even take photos while out and about. By adding a second wrist device, the team is adding unneeded complexity to the design as the Watch has to be able to pair not only with the iPhone, but with another device as well. Although the Avid Watch/Avid Track combo is reasonably priced at CAD$189, not having the Avid Track would drop the price of the Watch alone into a realm that would be even more affordable. The Avid team does point out that you can still run without wearing Avid Track or pairing the device with a smartphone -- you just won't get a route record. Conclusion Conclusion Since this is a Kickstarter campaign and there is obviously some work left to be done prior to the actual release of the product, I'm not going to provide one of our \"star ratings\" at this time. In summary, things I like about the Avid Watch include the easy-to-navigate user interface, the reasonable price point, the display clarity (especially in bright sunlight), and the multi-sport orientation. The main thing I'm not fond is the idea of wearing a second wristband to supply GPS, although that's a personal preference for me -- as we say in the blogging business, your mileage may vary if you don't always carry your smartphone with you. I noted during my recent review of the Wallograph that I wondered how anyone could even think about developing a smartwatch at this time when the twin gorillas in the room - Apple Watch and Android Wear -- are getting ready to unleash much more capable devices. Well, the Avid Watch is less expensive, and for a number of athletes it may be all they really need. is As with all crowdfunding projects, the public will get to \"vote\" for the Avid Watch with their wallets. The team has a goal of raising CDN$150,000 in the next 30 days, and I wish them the best of luck - they're obviously talented, but just need a bit more time and money to polish up the rough edges. Especially if you're a golfer, the Avid Watch has a lot to offer.

See Ramona Fricosu case. Supreme court decided that providing password to unlock computer is protected by 5th amendment and can be considered self incarceration.   Even though Ramona was charged with several compelling evidence against him, the data on his disk was never accessed.\n\nSince this ruling,  the law enforcement had a single choice, to go to the service providers and companies holding the data as a third party, specially when warrant is provided by the court.  Since providers are third party, 5th amendment does not apply.   What apple has done in response is to provide the ability to keep the encryption codes within the phone without sharing with apple, so in that way, apple can simply claim inability to access the data.\n\nThe bottom line is with the current system, any evidence stored in an encrypted iPhone, even in the case of most dangerous people, will never find its way to any court.

{"author": "Steven Sande", "url": "http://www.tuaw.com/2014/07/31/runtastic-orbit-the-new-activity-tracker-on-the-block/", "timestamp": "Jul 31st 2014 at 11:00AM", "authorTwitter": "http://twitter.com/stevensande", "comments": [], "content": "  It seems like everyone is getting into the wearables market these days. There's Fitbit, Misfit, Nike Fuel Band, Withings Pulse, and about twenty others I can think of. So when a new tracker shows up on the market, it has to have some redeeming value to make it stand out from all of the others. Recently I was approached by Runtastic about doing a review of their new Orbit fitness band (US$119.99). Runtastic is primarily known for a number of activity tracking apps as well as a hardware line with heart rate monitors and bike accessories among the favorites. Runtastic Orbit number of activity tracking apps Design Highlights Design Highlights The Runtastic Orbit is a tiny device about 1.89 x .71 x .35 (at thickest point) inches (4.8 x 1.8 x .9 cm), weighing just .3 ounce (8.5 grams). It's made of a translucent smoked plastic, although you'll rarely see that plastic because the tracker is installed into either a wristband or belt clip. Runtastic provides two wristbands and a belt clip with each device -- the review unit came with black and blue silicone wristbands, although you can also purchase accessory bands in other colors. The front of the Orbit is dominated by three things: an white on black OLED display, a large and easily pushed metal button, and a tiny light sensor that is barely visible. The back contains the recessed contacts for the USB charger. The wristbands are quite comfortable -- important if you're going to wear the Orbit 24 hours a day -- and designed so that they're very easy to put on. I've tested some fitness trackers that I've wanted to throw out simply because the wristbands were almost impossible to put on, but that's certainly not the case with the Orbit band. The belt clip (seen in the image at the top of this page) is also well designed. When you place the Runtastic Orbit into the flexible silicone rubber clip, it's upside down, which means that you can actually read the display -- smart design, since you don't have to take the clip off in order to read it. The clip also has a rather strong grip, important for making sure that you don't lose the Orbit.  Runtastic Orbit Runtastic Orbit Runtastic Orbit                  Battery life in my testing was about one week. At the end of that time, I simply recharged the Orbit using the included USB charging cable. During charging, an animated display shows the battery \"filling up\", which is a nice visual cue. One end of the cable plugs into a standard USB port, while the other end has two small contacts embedded into a plastic head that has a strong magnet in it. The design of the prototype cable caused a problem, which I'll describe in the next section of this review. Finally, the device synchronizes with a new, free Runtastic Me iOS app. That app can pass along information about your exercise to the Runtastic or Runtastic Pro apps. Runtastic Runtastic Pro Functionality Highlights Functionality Highlights As a fitness tracker, the Runtastic Orbit does a really good job. It tracks steps taken, sleep duration, will show calories burned, can be used as a watch and alarm, and as noted above, it has good battery life compared to a lot of trackers. Part of this is due to the fact that you need to push the button to see the time or how many steps you've taken -- that display is off otherwise, helping extend that battery life. Each push of the button takes you to another screen -- first the time, then steps taken, then calories burned, and finally active minutes. The display is easy to read both in dark rooms and in full sunlight.   Most fitness trackers are designed to work hand-in-hand with a companion app, and in this case, the default app is Runtastic Me. Upon launching the app, it connects to the device via Bluetooth and synchronizes automatically. The display of Runtastic Me shows the current number of steps taken, active minutes during the present day, the number of calories burned, distance walked in miles or kilometers and, if you've enabled sleep tracking, the hours of sleep you had the previous evening. Runtastic Me Tapping on any of the items displays more detailed stats, including a timeline of when you were active. By swiping up you can move to the detail displays for the other tracked items, and for things like steps taken, a tap and hold on the display shows how many steps you had take up until the selected time. Enabling sleep tracking is quite simple. You simply hold down the button for three seconds as you're going to sleep, and a \"bed\" icon appears to let you know you're now tracking sleep. When you're waking up, just hold down the button for three seconds again, and a \"sunrise\" animation is your indication that sleep tracking has been turned off. Launch the Runtastic Me app, and you'll have almost immediate data on how well (or poorly) you slept the previous evening. Runtastic shows that the device will do \"mood tracking\", but it did not appear that the feature has been enabled yet. The Orbit is also supposed to do ambient lighting tracking so that you can make sure that you're getting enough sunlight each day, but that is also something that will come in the future with a firmware upgrade. As with most of the fitness trackers on the market, Orbit uses vibration alerts to wake you up in the morning (alarms are set through the app) or to prompt you to get moving. It's a good strong vibration, guaranteed to get your attention. One of the best features of the Runtastic Orbit is that it is complete waterproof. You can swim with it on, take a shower, or even go diving down to 300 feet with it. No other fitness tracker is waterproof to that extent, and a number (Nike FuelBand SE, Withings Pulse O2, Fitbit Flex, Jawbone UP24) are either just water-resistant or have no ability to withstand water at all. I was quite impressed with the fact that the Orbit lives up to its battery life of 7 days. That's almost exactly what I got from a full charge. The accuracy of the Orbit's step tracker is up for debate. I matched the steps taken with another activity tracker as well as my iPhone 5s, and when I used the belt clip, the numbers were almost identical. I did see lower step numbers when I used the wristband, which was a bit of an anomaly. Charging with the prototype magnetic charging cable (blue cable below) caused a problem at one point. The magnet in the cable made it stick to the metal end of another cable, shorting it out and melting the charging cable. I reported the issue to Runtastic; they are redesigning the charger cable (I was using a prototype) and will have a revised version with all shipping Orbits. I would still recommend unplugging the cable when it is not in use.   Conclusion Conclusion Runtastic's Orbit activity tracker is another welcome entry to an increasingly crowded market. At $119.99, it's slightly more expensive than the Nike FuelBand SE, Fitbit Flex, Misfit Shine and the Polar Loop, less expensive than the Jawbone UP24 and Garmin Vivofit, and the same price as the Withings Pulse O2. Waterproof to 300 feet, with some planned features (mood and ambient light tracking) that don't exist on most competitors, a choice of how the device is worn, good battery life, and a well-designed app, the Orbit is a solid competitor. Two factors -- the lower step count when worn as a wristband and two advertised features that are not working at this time -- are keeping me from giving the Orbit a top score.

Some of the fitness monitors I've reviewed over the past few years have been amazing, with accuracy, good battery life, and interaction with apps that track your activity and inspire you to do more. A handful have been just awful, with battery life issues, crashes, and apps that weren't thought out. And there were the ugly devices - and I mean they were awful to look at. The Wellograph (US$349) certainly isn't an ugly device, and it's one of the more innovative fitness devices I've seen so far. But like so many others fitness monitors that are rushing to market, it seems to be a work in progress.    Wellograph Specifications Specifications Dimensions: 1.65 x 1.30 x 0.5 inch (42 x 33 x 12.5 mm) Weight: 3.52 ounce (55 grams) Display: 1.26 inch low-power LCD with backlight Sensors: 9-axis motion sensor, Tri-LED heart rate sensor Connectivity: Bluetooth 4.0 LE Battery life: 7 days per charge (210 mAh) Waterproof: 5 ATM, up to 50 meters or 160 feet Materials: Anodized aluminum lower case, stainless steel upper case, spherical sapphire crystal. Design   The case comes in two different finishes: Silver Satin with a brown leather strap and Black Chrome with a black leather strap. Additional straps are available for $49 each either in leather or as a black nylon Nato strap. One of the big selling points of the Wellograph is that it uses a sapphire crystal - the exact material that was expected on the iPhone 6 models (it does exist on the Touch ID home button) and that will be on several models of the Apple Watch. That should help to keep the crystal from being scratched, and in testing for almost a month the crystal remained scratch-free despite some accidental bumps. The user interface is controlled by two buttons on the right side of the case, which might make it difficult for left-handed people to use and wear. Unlike the Apple Watch, the display operates only in one orientation while being worn so it can't be flipped.   Wellograph Wellograph Wellograph                  Most fitness tracker UIs use a single button to cycle through a number of screens. The two buttons on the Wellograph are used to scroll through text-based menus on the device and select those menu items. While the UI is rather easy to pick up and understand, I found that changing the settings on the device was cumbersome. It's definitely a lot easier to do that through a smartphone app like so many other devices. The display is kind of schizophrenic, at times both wonderful and annoying. Outside in bright sunshine, it's a joy to use, with large white letters appearing on a stark black background. On cloudy days or in a darkened room, you'll find it's difficult to read the display without using the backlight. Once selected in the settings, the backlight turns on while you're pushing buttons, then fades to darkness over a few seconds. At the bottom of the default digital time display are three small icons. One shows the relative battery charge level, the middle one is the current day of the month, and the last is a heart-shaped icon that visually displays how far you've come toward your daily exercise goal. The Wellograph app tries to steer you to do 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise daily. The strap on the Wellograph is a standard leather strap that is quite comfortable. For those who are more active or wish to take the device swimming (it is waterproof!) there's a nylon Nato band. For charging, there's a magnetic dock that the watch rests on, displaying a \"sideways clock\" while the device is getting power. is Function Function Part of my comment about the Wellograph feeling like a work in progress has to do with how new the device is; during my weeks of testing, I was notified about three firmware updates. Those are done through the iPhone app via Bluetooth The Bluetooth syncing seems just plain odd. Most devices have a simple way to sync, where you just push a button and the device contacts your iPhone and begins a sync. Not here. Syncing the Wellograph involves launching the app and tapping sync, at which time you're asked to \"Select an accessory.\" Huh? I finally realized that it was trying to find the Wellograph, which it didn't do automatically because the device turns Bluetooth off in between syncs. To turn it on, you turn to the watch, and then have to punch the two buttons a total of ten times to cycle through menus and turn Bluetooth on just long enough for your iPhone and Wellograph to talk to each other. Sure, turning off Bluetooth is a great way to make sure that your device isn't constantly burning up battery power, but I'd much rather charge the device once a day than have to punch buttons every time I want to sync the device. Even my $35 Virgin Pulse Max has a better sync design than this, and it has a battery that lasts for about six months! With it, I just punch one button seven times quickly until the screen says \"Sync\", launch the app, and the two devices communicate and transfer info. Done. To achieve that 7-day per charge battery life, the Wellograph seems to make some other sacrifices: the display backlight that's only on when you're pushing buttons and a \"power saver mode\" that you have to remember to get out of by pushing a button. The first day of use I didn't know I had to push that button to \"wake\" the Wellograph, so it didn't track my steps until much later in the day when I actually \"woke\" it. Since that power saver mode seems to enable itself when there's not too much activity (it thinks you're asleep), the Wellograph enabled the mode many times while I was working at my desk. Since I didn't look at the watch face obsessively, I wasn't aware until later that it wasn't tracking my steps. A step tracker is worthless unless it's constantly tracking your steps. One feature that is pretty cool is the heart rate sensor - a similar sensor will be on the back of every Apple Watch as well. All you need to do to measure heart rate is to push buttons until you get to the BPM screen. Initially, a heart shape pulsed along with my heart until it got an average reading, at which it stopped and displayed that reading. On occasion I found that it would \"beat\" but not display a beats-per-minute figure, which made me wonder if I had just died. Not good. After one of the firmware updates, the heart rate sensor changed to an actual EKG-like heart trace. I compared the Wellograph BPM figure with that from both another smartphone-enabled device - a Withings Blood Pressure Monitor - and with the time-tested manual method. In all cases, the heart rate was within a few BPM, so it looks like their sensor is right on the money.     Wellograph App Wellograph App Wellograph App                  The app displays a home screen with three big icons on it: Activity, Heart, and Sessions. Activity shows your current step and calorie count, as well as a daily, weekly and monthly total. I found it rather odd that when I tried to change my daily step goal in the user profile settings, it took quite a while for the change to \"take\", leading me to wonder if the app had frozen. One other oddity with the settings: regardless of how many times I put in my birthdate, it kept reverting to one year later days after I'd save it. I guess being a year younger is a benefit of using Wellograph. I also found the Wellograph's step counting function to be well off of what two other devices - my iPhone 6 Plus and that cheap Virgin Pulse device - agreed on. It was always somewhat on the low side to the tune of almost 20 - 25 percent of my step total. I've noticed similar low numbers for some other wrist-worn fitness trackers - the Misfit Shine, for example - while other devices have been right on the money. The Heart display is fascinating, showing the amount of cardio time you've put in and displaying light, moderate and vigorous activity by percentage of total. When you swipe the screen to the left, you get a display of your heart rate - high, low, and average for a day, week or month.   Conclusion Conclusion After several weeks of putting the Wellograph through the daily routine, I found that it is one of the more comfortable fitness trackers I've worn, and it looks good. It gets the advertised one week of battery life, but at the expense of display clarity indoors, continuous tracking, and ease of syncing. The bottom line, though, is that there are a number of less expensive fitness trackers that do the same job as well or better than the Wellograph. With the Apple Watch on the horizon, able to do health tracking as well as running a variety of apps to do just about anything and display all of those on a vibrant color screen, is there really a place in the market for a $349 monochrome device that performs just a handful of functions? At a lesser price, I could see a place for Wellograph for those people who don't necessarily want an app-enabled battery hog on their wrists. If you need a device that wouldn't look out of place in a boardroom, that's waterproof, and that just tracks fitness factors, then Wellograph might be for you.

That was the case with StandStand, which fellow TUAW editor Dave Caolo pointed out to me.

Wouldn't a developer want his or her app to be just a click away from purchase on the Mac App Store? As noted by \u00c7ingleton attendee and SixColors.com creator Jason Snell, Siegel wasn't frustrated with the things most people would believe were the reason for quitting the Mac App Store. It's wasn't Apple's 30 percent cut of profits, the lack of a relationship with his App Store customers, the marketing challenges or even the craziness of following Apple's submission guidelines. SixColors.com creator Jason Snell Instead, it was the cumulative effect of all of these frustrations, most of which occur at the end of the development cycle just before shipping a product. Siegel came to the realization that the extra stress and frustration just weren't worth the hassle of being in the Mac App Store, so for at least the immediate future, BBEdit will be available only from the Bare Bones Software website. all Siegel doesn't count out the possibility of returning to the App Store in the future if some of the irritations are worked out. But at the present time, the company can concentrate on continually improving its popular editing app, keeping in touch with its customers, and developing new features without the extra added stress.

This isn't just the NFL - all sports leagues (US and other - try playing in a FIFA tournament wearing or using logo'ed gear from someone other than a sponsor and see how far you get) and I assume any other organization that gets major sponsorship money will have as part of the sponsorship agreement limitations on (recognizable) use of items from the sponsor's competitors by people affiliated with the organization.  This isn't a free speech thing - this is a money thing and an employment agreement thing.
